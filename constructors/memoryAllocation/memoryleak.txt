MEMORY LEAK 
a memory leak occurs when  a program dynamically allocates memory but fails to release it after its no longer needed


As a result :
 -> that memory stays "reserved" for the program ;
 -> the opertaing system can't reuse it .
 -> Over time if leaks keep happening the program will consecutive more and more memory 
    possibly crashing or slowing down the system.

DESTRUCTOR
 ->Destructor is a special member function in C++ .
 ->it is used to destroy objects and release resources .
 -> Automatically called when the object goes out of scope .
 -> Denoted with tilde (~)symbol before class name .
 
 KEY Characteristics->
       name is same as class but predefine with(~)
     .no return type.
     . no parameter allowed .
     . only one destructor per class(cannot be overloaded);
     .called in reverse order of Constructor calls .

USE CASES:
        -> releasing dynamically allocated memory .
        -> closing files and database connections 
        -> freeing resources like socket threads handles etc .
        -> preventing memory leaks in programs.

STATIC MEMBER 
 -> declaerd inside a class with the keyword static .
 -> shared by all objects of the class (only one copy exists ).
 -> memory is allocated once . not per objects ,
 -> must be defined outside the class as well .


STATIC MEMBER function
 decleared inside a class with the keyword ststic .
 can be called without an object using  ClassName :: functions ().
 Can only access static data member's( since they don"t belonging to any specified object )
