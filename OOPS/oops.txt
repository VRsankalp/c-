ENCAPSULATION --
-- Encapsulaton is th binding of data and methods together into a single unit (class).
--Also known as Data.
-- Achived using access specifiers (private , public , protected ).

KEY POINTS --
--Protects data from direct access .
--Only allows controlled access through methods .
--Makes program secure and modular .

ADVANTAGES ---
--Data Hiding -> sensitive data secure .
--Code Reusibility -> well - structure data .
--Modularity -> each class acts as a capsule .
--Easy Maintenance 

ACCESS MODIFER
--Public-- 
        .Member decleared as public are accesible from anywhere inside the class , outside class , and in 
        derived class.
        -Used when you want free access to class members .

--Privte--
        -Member declared as private are accesible only inside the class .
        -They cannot be accesed directly .

--protected--
        -members declared as protected as accessible inside the  class and in derived classes . but not from outsid
            in the class.
        -useful for inheritance when you want child classes to use members , but not outsiders.


INHERITANCE --
    Mechanisem of deriving new classes (derived /classes) from existing classes (base / parent ).
     --Example-- 
        :Vehicle -> Car , Bike 
        :
