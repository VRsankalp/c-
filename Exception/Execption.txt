============   Compile time erroe =================
>ocurs when thw rules of the programming language are violated .
>Detected by the compiler during compilation .
>prevents the program from running .
Example --
        Missing semicolo(;)
        Using undeclared variables
        >Mismatched parenthses.

----  Logical Error -----  
>ocurs when the program runs sucessfully but the produces wrong or unexpectd results .
>Usually due to mistakes  in the logic/algorithm of the program.


================================-----------Exception-----------============================
it is an error ocurred during the execution of the program .

 >>>> Run time error >>>
        . occure while the progarm is running .
        >Not detected by the compiler .
        >Usually leads to abnormal termiantion id not handled .
        ..Example 
                Divison by zero 
                Invalid array index 
                .File not found .


Keywords in execption ..
try -> block of code that may cause execption
throw-> used to raise n excepton.
catch -> block that handles the execption

if else is not use as in case of try and catch because some erorrs are not define 
where as in try and catch we cannot determine the error 
// try {
        //code that may throw execpt
        throe Exception_value ;
}
//catch (type_exception_var ){
        //handle Exception
}


>>if - else -> preventing the error from happening by chcecking condition befor dividing
>> execprtion -> allow the program to react if an occure unexceptedly
